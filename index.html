<p>The repositories Isopleth has are:</p>

<article><a href="https://github.com/isopleth/jCVSim">jCVSim</a>
<p>Port of CVSim 1.16 cardiovascular simulation program to be
completely in Java, and simulation of breathing and intrathoracic
pressure and reflex effects of breathing added.</p></article>

<article><a href="https://github.com/isopleth/kinetics">kinetics</a>
<p>Programs for the analysis of AX3 accelerometer data.</p></article>

<article><a href="https://github.com/isopleth/javaCVSim">javaCVSim</a> 
<p>Port of the CVSim 1.16 cardiovascular simulation program to pure
Java.  CVSim has a Java GUI and a C simulation engine; this program
has the simulation engine ported to Java and some small changes made
to it, mainly to improve readability.  Basically, jCVSim without the
respiration enhancements</p></article>

<article><a href="https://github.com/isopleth/zetasdr">zetasdr</a>
<p>C++ simulation of the ZetaSDR radio (http://www.qrz.lt/ly1gp/SDR/),
a simple software defined radio receiver based on a Tayloe quadrature
product detector.  The radio was designed by a Lithuanian radio
amateur, call sign LY1GP, and is popular amongst enthusiasts as a way
of getting started with building SDRs because of the very small part
count. This program plots out different electronic signals in detail,
to help people understand how it works. My motivation was that I was
running electronics tutorials for a class of students who were tasked
with building their own versions of software defined radios loosely
based on the ZetaSDR, and so the plots from the program were both for
my benefit and theirs.</p></article>

<article><a href="https://github.com/isopleth/fram">fram</a>
<p>Prepares files for a digital photo frame. The main things that it does 
are to add user-specified titles to the images in jpeg files and randomises their order.</p></article>

<article><a href="https://github.com/isopleth/relaxation">relaxaion</a> 
<p>Simulates a relaxation oscillator to determine its oscillation
  frequency</p></article>

<article><a href="https://github.com/isopleth/repword">repword</a>
 <p>Program copies the text files specified as command line parameters to
 stdout, removing repeated words in the process.</p></article>

<article><a href="https://github.com/isopleth/jlcompress">jlcompress</a>
 <p>Program copies the text files specified as command line parameters 
to stdout, removing repeated words in the process.</p></article>
